# PIC16BProject

**Group Name:** The Drip Gurus <br>
**Project Topic:** Outfit recommendation webapp <br>
**Group Members:** Cara Keogh, Patrick Wang, Yu-Hsin Huang <br>

## Questions for Professor Chodrow:

1. Is there anyway to make our website more user-friendly?
2. Is there anything we can do to improve our recommendation algorithm in terms of efficiency?
3. How can we connect our recommendation algorithm in the .ipynb file to our app.py file? 

```
write a thorough demonstration of the functionality of your project in the top-level README.md file. Think of this as a tutorial for someone who wants to learn to use your tools. You may find it easiest to write this in a Jupyter Notebook and then render the results as a Markdown file, in much the same way that you worked on previous blog posts. 

If you created a webapp or other project for which the user is not expected to directly interact with code, you may instead use this space to carefully describe what your app does and what its limitations might be. An acceptable alternative would be to include such a writeup on your app's page, in which case your README.md file should link to that page. 

If you created an app, please ensure that I am able to interact with it. You can do this either by deploying it to the web or by including careful instructions on how I can run the app and what I should do to observe its functionality.
