## What You Will Learn
On the technical side, our project will utilize image classification packages such as Keras. Then, we will learn the concept of convolutional neural networks to extract useful information from images. As for the recommender system, we will implement content-based filtering techniques to recognize the usersâ€™ preferred style, and suggest a similar outfit for the user. Moreover, we will develop our algorithm in a form of webapp, so we will utilize Flask to manage our dynamic web application. Additionally, since this is a group project, we will learn version control, which allows all of us to work simultaneously on the project. We will mainly collaborate and store our repository on Git. While working in groups, we can also learn some project management principles such as setting goals, creating a project timeline, distributing work, and so on.
