## What You Will Learn
On the technical side, our project will utilize image classification packages such as Keras. Then, we will learn the concept of convolutional neural networks to extract useful information from images. As for the recommender system, we will implement content-based filtering techniques to recognize the users’ preferred style, and suggest a similar outfit for the user. Moreover, we will develop our algorithm in a form of webapp, so we will utilize Flask to manage our dynamic web application. Additionally, since this is a group project, we will learn version control, which allows all of us to work simultaneously on the project. We will mainly collaborate and store our repository on Git. While working in groups, we can also learn some project management principles such as setting goals, creating a project timeline, distributing work, and so on.

## Risks
First, by achieving our full deliverable, the users will be able to upload their clothes and our algorithm will automatically match the outfits for the users. During this process, one potential risk would be that the algorithm is unable to recognize and categorize the clothes uploaded. This may be due to the clothes that are uploaded do not match any of the data we have, or the accuracy of the algorithm is not high enough to classify the clothes. Secondly, since our recommender system will be built based on the users’ selected preference, if the user does not have enough clothes that match his/her preference, the algorithm might not be able to suggest outfits properly. Since the sample size of choices is too small, the accuracy of the algorithm may be totally off.
